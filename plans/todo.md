# Pong WebRTC Game - Development Todo List

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Create React app with `create-react-app pong-webrtc`
- [ ] Install dependencies:
  - [ ] `redux` and `@reduxjs/toolkit`
  - [ ] `react-redux`
  - [ ] `express` and `ws` (for signaling server)
  - [ ] `jest` and `@testing-library/react`
- [ ] Set up project structure
  - [ ] Create component folders
  - [ ] Set up Redux store structure
  - [ ] Create initial CSS files
- [ ] Create basic signaling server
  - [ ] Set up Express server
  - [ ] Add WebSocket support
  - [ ] Implement basic error handling

## Phase 2: Core Game Components
- [ ] Create basic game components
  - [ ] Game container
  - [ ] Scoreboard
  - [ ] Game board
  - [ ] Paddles
  - [ ] Ball
- [ ] Implement Redux store
  - [ ] Create game slice
  - [ ] Create player slice
  - [ ] Create connection slice
  - [ ] Configure store with middleware
- [ ] Implement game styling
  - [ ] Retro black and white aesthetic
  - [ ] Paddle and ball styling
  - [ ] Scoreboard layout
  - [ ] Center line styling
- [ ] Create device orientation detection for mobile

## Phase 3: Game Physics and Logic
- [ ] Implement ball movement logic
  - [ ] Basic movement with velocity
  - [ ] Wall collision detection
  - [ ] Paddle collision detection
  - [ ] Scoring when ball passes paddle
- [ ] Implement paddle movement
  - [ ] Mouse/touch input handling
  - [ ] Smooth transition to target position
  - [ ] Boundary constraints
- [ ] Create game state management
  - [ ] Lobby state with ready button
  - [ ] Countdown state (5,4,3,2,1)
  - [ ] Playing state
  - [ ] Paused state
  - [ ] Game over state
- [ ] Implement scoring system
  - [ ] Point tracking
  - [ ] Game end at 10 points
  - [ ] Win tracking with tick marks

## Phase 4: Networking with WebRTC
- [ ] Implement WebSocket signaling server
  - [ ] Handle player connections
  - [ ] Implement player matching
  - [ ] Relay WebRTC connection data
  - [ ] Handle disconnections
- [ ] Implement WebRTC connection
  - [ ] Create peer connection with Google's STUN server
  - [ ] Implement data channel for game data
  - [ ] Handle connection state changes
  - [ ] Create offer/answer exchange logic
- [ ] Implement host-authority game model
  - [ ] Host handles physics and game state
  - [ ] Client receives updates and sends inputs
  - [ ] Synchronize game state between peers
- [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Connection lost scenarios
  - [ ] Reconnection attempts
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages

## Phase 5: Game Features and Polish
- [ ] Implement sound effects
  - [ ] Paddle hit sound
  - [ ] Wall hit sound
  - [ ] Score sound
  - [ ] Game start/end sounds
  - [ ] Sound on/off toggle
- [ ] Add player name editing
  - [ ] Default names from list
  - [ ] Editable names before game start
- [ ] Implement game controls
  - [ ] Ready button functionality
  - [ ] Pause button
  - [ ] Game restart after completion
- [ ] Add visual feedback
  - [ ] Countdown animation
  - [ ] Score change animation
  - [ ] Game winner display

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Write unit tests
  - [ ] Game physics tests
  - [ ] Component rendering tests
  - [ ] Redux state tests
- [ ] Write integration tests
  - [ ] Game flow tests
  - [ ] WebRTC connection tests (mocked)
  - [ ] WebSocket server tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary renders
  - [ ] Optimize animation frame handling
  - [ ] Test on various devices
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
  - [ ] Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - [ ] Mobile browsers
- [ ] Deploy application
  - [ ] Deploy signaling server
  - [ ] Set up HTTPS for WebRTC
  - [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting service (Vercel, etc.)
