- [x] Set up project structure
  - [x] Create component folders
  - [x] Set up Redux store structure
  - [x] Create initial CSS files
- [x] Create basic signaling server
  - [x] Set up Express server
  - [x] Add WebSocket support
  - [x] Implement basic error handling

## Phase 2: Core Game Components
- [x] Create basic game components
  - [x] Game container
  - [x] Scoreboard
  - [x] Game board
  - [x] Paddles
  - [x] Ball
- [x] Implement Redux store
  - [x] Create game slice
  - [x] Create player slice
  - [x] Create connection slice
  - [x] Configure store with middleware
- [x] Implement game styling
  - [x] Retro black and white aesthetic
  - [x] Paddle and ball styling
  - [x] Scoreboard layout
  - [x] Center line styling
- [x] Create device orientation detection for mobile

## Phase 3: Game Physics and Logic
- [x] Implement ball movement logic
  - [x] Basic movement with velocity
  - [x] Wall collision detection
  - [x] Paddle collision detection
  - [x] Scoring when ball passes paddle
- [x] Implement paddle movement
  - [x] Mouse/touch input handling
  - [x] Smooth transition to target position
  - [x] Boundary constraints
- [x] Create game state management
  - [x] Lobby state with ready button
  - [x] Countdown state (5,4,3,2,1)
  - [x] Playing state
  - [x] Paused state
  - [x] Game over state
- [x] Implement scoring system
  - [x] Point tracking
  - [x] Game end at 10 points
  - [x] Win tracking with tick marks

## Phase 4: Networking with WebRTC
- [x] Implement WebSocket signaling server
  - [x] Handle player connections
  - [x] Implement player matching
  - [x] Relay WebRTC connection data
  - [x] Handle disconnections
- [x] Implement WebRTC connection
  - [x] Create peer connection with Google's STUN server
  - [x] Implement data channel for game data
  - [x] Handle connection state changes
  - [x] Create offer/answer exchange logic
- [ ] Implement host-authority game model
  - [ ] Host handles physics and game state
  - [ ] Client receives updates and sends inputs
  - [ ] Synchronize game state between peers
- [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Connection lost scenarios
  - [ ] Reconnection attempts
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages

## Phase 5: Game Features and Polish
- [ ] Implement sound effects
  - [ ] Paddle hit sound
  - [ ] Wall hit sound
  - [ ] Score sound
  - [ ] Game start/end sounds
  - [ ] Sound on/off toggle
- [ ] Add player name editing
  - [ ] Default names from list
  - [ ] Editable names before game start
- [ ] Implement game controls
  - [ ] Ready button functionality
  - [ ] Pause button
  - [ ] Game restart after completion
- [ ] Add visual feedback
  - [ ] Countdown animation
  - [ ] Score change animation
  - [ ] Game winner display

## Phase 6: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Write integration tests
  - [ ] Game flow tests
  - [ ] WebRTC connection tests (mocked)
  - [ ] WebSocket server tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary renders
  - [ ] Optimize animation frame handling
  - [ ] Test on various devices
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
  - [ ] Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - [ ] Mobile browsers
- [ ] Deploy application
  - [ ] Deploy signaling server
  - [ ] Set up HTTPS for WebRTC
  - [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting service (Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Thik about refactoring connection logic in reducers to middleware
